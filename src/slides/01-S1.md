## Taking responsibility and being able to identify and plan out tasks needed to deliver user-interface based websites, services and applications.

> The ability to plan out tasks is something I have been working hard towards since this program began. 📤

Agile methodology is the main toolkit I have used to help plan out tasks I needed to complete, 
and to help prioritize. Kanban boards are the main method I use to track my projects during ideation to development. 

For example, during this individual project I completed 3 separate sites;

<p class='subText'>ok I made that in an afternoon, so not so much kanban. I am just very excited for this movie</p>

<p class='subText'>still have the kanban board up for this project, development is ongoing</p>

I am not sure I would have been able to complete these projects if it wasn't for using Kanban boards to organize tasks. I also have come to learn to love moving the sticky notes to the next line, and taking a moment to celebrate moving a project forward.

While I have used online tools like Miro for Kanban boards, I have repurposed my office door to use as one as I have moved from project to project and I much prefer this method.

I have also taken to adopting rapid iteration, utilizing continuous deployment from services like Netlify. Where I can deliver working software quickly and get changes out in smaller pieces rather than large changes.<br></br>
For example on my personal portfolio page, that was deployed with no animations working, and missing certain key aspects I wanted to include. However, because i deployed it early, I was able to send it out to potential employers and secure an internship before it was in its final state.

Another toolkit I have utilized is my existing knowledge in the principals of design. This has allowed me to leverage those skills and translate them into effective UI design. I use Figma on almost every project, planning out the design and the elements I want to include. <br></br>
I also use figma to create component breakdowns. This is great as I can easily reference the Figma file to prevent me from having to think. Like which column the component needs to occupy, and how to structure components in JSX.

Here is a simpler version of the breakdown, where I have labeled the columns I intended to use on the page to help me quickly identify where things would be placed.

Here is an example of the component breakdown of a design I created. Here I can quickly reference component structure and this project was one that really showed me the importance of planning the project early. Since I took the time to do this development was much quicker, and this assignment was one of 2 we had to complete in a week. So speed was critical.

# 🏆
This evidence shows I am able to plan out and execute projects from ideation to deployment. That I am able to break down tasks and utilize tools to help keep me organized and moving projects forward.
