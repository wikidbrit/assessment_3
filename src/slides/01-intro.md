> The ability to plan out tasks is something I have been working hard towards since this program began.

Agile methodology is the main toolkit I have used to help plan out tasks I needed to complete, 
and to help prioritize. Kanban boards are the main method I use to track my projects during ideation to development. 

For example, during this individual project I completed 3 separate sites;

[Matrix Countdown Clock](https://matrix-countdown-clock.netlify.app)

I am not sure I would have been able to complete these projects if it wasn't for using Kanban boards to organize tasks. I also have come to learn to love moving the sticky notes to the next line, and taking a moment to celebrate moving a project forward.

While I have used online tools like Miro for Kanban boards, I have repurposed my office door to use as one as I have moved from project to project and I much prefer this method. 

---

I have also taken to adopting rapid iteration, utilizing continuous deployment from services like Netlify. Where I can deliver working software quickly and get changes out in smaller pieces rather than large changes.<br></br>
For example on my personal portfolio page, that was deployed with no animations working, and missing certain key aspects I wanted to include. However I was able to send it out and secure an internship before it was in its final state.
